## Note
Pizza is still under development and I do not recommend using it right now. This notice will change when Pizza build 1.0 is
released.

## Building pizza
To build pizza from source open the Pizza folder in terminal and run 
```
MAC/LINUX
./mvnw clean compile assembly:single
WINDOWS
mvnw clean compile assembly:single
```
Or if you have a maven install you can just run
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single

```
I dont recommend doing this though so read the Installer docs [here](https://interfiber.github.io/docs/pizza-installer)
