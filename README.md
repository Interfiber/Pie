A Lightweight programming language built on the JVM

## Note
Pizza is still under development and I do not recommend using it right now. This notice will change when Pizza build 1.0 is
released.

## Building pizza
To build pizza from source open the Pizza folder in terminal and run 
```
MAC/LINUX
./gradlew build
WINDOWS
gradlew build
```
Or if you have gradle installed you can just run
```
gradle build

```
I dont recommend doing this though so read the Installer docs [here](https://interfiber.github.io/docs/pizza-installer)
