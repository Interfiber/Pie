# Weekly Snapshot Ideas:
- [x] Arrays(Who doesn't love arrays?)
- [ ] Json, Yaml, Xml, Toml, Parsers
- [x] user Input(I keep forgetting to do this)
- [ ] MORE MATH FUNCTIONS!!!(Like PI, Square)
- [x] Get System env vars and System properties
- [ ] Sound Class(PLAY THAT MUSIC LOUD AND CLEAR FROM MY TERMINAL!)

Window Class Removed Because OpenGl And Javafx AND LWJGL Would Not Work Maybe Later.
